### Basic Features

Next, you'll want to familiarize yourself with the features available in Setster Studio by reviewing the [available step types](https://www.setster.com/docs/studio/getting-started/features).

### Logic Flow

The logic flow defines the sequence of form steps, customizes content for user relevance, and governs step navigation rules, serving as the core logic behind form interaction. [Read Logic Flow Docs](https://www.setster.com/docs/studio/configuration/logic-flow/overview)

### Summaries

Summaries in the settings.json file enable the presentation of user selections as a summary before submitting contact information for a new appointment with a service provider. [Read Summaries Docs](https://www.setster.com/docs/studio/configuration/summaries)

### Data Collection

There are three primary approaches to managing data collection in Setster: configuring metadata via the Setting.json file, prefilling essential booking form fields (like client details), and configuring custom hidden booking form field values.
