        ## Please help us help you!

        Before filing your issue, ask yourself:
        - Is this clearly a Setster Studio defect? 
        - Could it be an issue with your settings.json configuration? Did you confirm your JSON file is valid with the Studio [Schema Validator Tool](https://setster.com/docs/studio/getting-started/debugging#schema-validator)?
        - Could it be because of my own mistakes?

        The quickest way to verify whether it's a Studio defect is by creating a **reproduction** of the issue using something like a code sandbox. When creating a reproducible bug sandbox be sure to make the bug obvious focus of the sandbox.

        Bugs are fixed faster if you include:
        - A repro sandbox to inspect the code
        - An url to see the problem live (if possible)
